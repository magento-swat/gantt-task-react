This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the gantt-task-react package in the parent directory for development purposes.
* `docker-compose up -d`
* Project shell be accesible by `http://127.0.0.1:3101/`


Without docker: you can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to test your package.
